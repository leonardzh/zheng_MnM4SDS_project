# Project Title: Urban Dynamics
## Update 12/01
### Finished:
Simple linear regression can be realized in Step0 neural network.

### Ongoing:
introduce NNSI

## Update 10/29
### Finished:

NYC Taxi/Bike data processing (SI.ipynb)

Gravity spatial interaction prototyping (austria.ipynb)

BP neural network prototyping (austria.ipynb)

### Ongoing:
Newly added Taxi_nn.ipynb:

**Part 1**

Processing and generate Data of NYC Taxi

Almost done. Is ready for use in part 2 and part 3

**Part 2**

Using PyTorch to implement LSTM model

Too advanced. Put away for now

**Part 3**
Manual simple NN

**Tuning now** Hand writing numpy based Neural Net with 3 input and 1 output features.

### Todo:
Data formating from Taxi dataframe to LSTM input features

(partial done)LSTM neural network prototyping (LSTM.ipynb)

Calibration of models

Explanation of models
